"""Those who are enjoying the suffering of others should reflect and ask Allah to do the same with israel [that is not possible for allah]. However, this is a natural disaster, not an action of Allah, if He/She/It is truly God. You may  realize the harm in celebrating someone’s death is not good if u are truly religious . Supporting humanity is essential, and while supporting Gaza is commendable but celebrating death or suffering is not the way. Remember, Allah may be against you if you think like this. Pray to God to help all innocent people—whether they are from Gaza, usa or elsewhere. This lack of compassion is one of the reasons your community [Muslims]faces trust issues worldwide. We all share responsibility for this.""🙏",[],2025-01-16T10:34:05Z,@gauravayodhyi8970

"The need of the hour is for the winds to stop and the area needs to have a good rainfall for few days to put out the fires. For winds to stop Hanuman chalisa chanting , as Lord Hanuman is son of wind god will help and for rains, a ritual called Varuna Japam to invoke the rain god will help. In Hinduism, the Hanuman Chalisa is believed to provide immense power against physical dangers, as it invokes Lord Hanuman, a deity known for his immense strength and courage, essentially offering protection and the ability to overcome obstacles, both physical and metaphorical, through devotion and recitation of the prayer; people often chant it to seek safety and resilience in the face of potential threats or challenges",[],2025-01-15T15:55:05Z,@jayaramabbaraju7489

"Well telling stories, it’s not going to solve the issue and there are thousands of stories from ordinary people who are victims of neglect of human society to protect them from suffering and people usually rich and have insurance and money to rebuild. It’s good for economy, new jobs for ordinary people and absolutely the building code must be changed and I know what needs to be done and I know that people didn’t see me as human being as they are and as they have need to have rooftop over their heads so as I need that, food and money to survive not for lavish lifestyle for lifestyle that my human body has comfort to comfort Divine power that keeps and Leeds this natural lifecycle of this mortal body. I am only one connected to Divine power of all lifecycle of visible world and when I was trying to understand my human senses of all natural lifecycle and same time providing for my human mortal body and taking responsibility to help my children because it’s my human bloodline that really matters for me personally and always have. I don’t intervene in their personal lives because they live like mine has begun in Divine and they should learn their limits and they reason for human life, respect my bloodline because my human life somehow continues through blood cells but priority that Divine power keeps them moving and being a life is above and beyond your human mind comprehension. Despite all your efforts to destroy me I am here and my human body is a life because I am here not serve you mortals but Divine Power of all life and live my human life as anyone else. I am only one that connected to the source of all life I know that through the power of life within my mortal body despite all your manipulation of my human mind, but I am not the one that you waiting to save you, it’s your belief not mine, keep believing and keep waiting because I don’t believe and I don’t wait because I know no one is coming to save no one. Everyone is capable to save themselves by adjusting to natural changes on planet earth. They were they are and they always will be it’s natural lifecycle that not created by mortals that forget that they time on earth is limited due to their natural lifecycle. 
As I have told you not long ago that there was shift in core of earth angle, trying to find words to describe because your stupidity to understand simplicity is overwhelming and your fantasy and conspiracy runs high on what I say, the earthquake in Virginia is proof that magma moves to New England volcanic chamber. 
Climate itself itself is above the ground natural lifecycle and its not rockets since to understand that those ruins from previous civilisation not from climate change only but as I said before it’s change in natural lifecycle of planet and I didn’t understand how you don’t sense that it’s because of your priorities earthly wealth, greed and worship your mortal flesh not the power that keeps you a life and everyone and everything around you. No morons by sensing natural lifecycle of planet earth and all life around me that is not what I want it’s what it’s and what I sense !!! And up to day I sense manipulation, I sense people still getting to my place and poisoning my food and I don’t want that and nothing much I can do but change locks on my door this time coded one because others I have changed were open and I sensed the energy of strangers in my place and I tried to figure it out what was the reason and reason I knew when I start to have issues. But Divine power senses what I sense and controls all life energy of anyone, you fools can’t fool the power that keeps you a life because your actions are sensed by Divine intelligence and through the power of life you will attract what you wish for me but in different forms because of different lifestyles. Don’t cry you are the reason for my suffering and you are getting way above what you caused based on Divine Law of Justice without privilege. 
You can use your creativity to adopt to changes if you want to survive and I am sure I am not telling anyone to go take what belongs to others but definitely government of all nations must take responsibility for their nations and world community restore Equality in justice for everyone without privilege. No invasion of one nation by another, and being nato member doesn’t mean you can invade another country and take their land !!!
It’s not about being recognised it’s about Justice. You don’t take what belongs to others as you don’t want them to take what belongs to you. Balance and respect it’s so little to stop madness of man world, yeah system that is created by man and it’s run by man without any human senses because they all about themselves and their creation that forget that they creation is on planet earth that is created not by man and has own rules and regulations system in place. Ok lunatics fight the power that keeps your mortal flesh a life. 
I know British intelligence is behind manipulation now. 
No I am not for merchants manipulation for earthly wealth I am here to use your system but you abused your power by trying to make me your slave. No that was time when you took European women and sold like animals on market to be with man without their natural senses of being in love. I am in love naturally with the Power that keeps my mortal flesh a life and  through that power I am connected to the source of my life and I know source of all life.
I know merchant have sold their souls and they cannot reach the life of eternity because they devoted themselves to earthly purpose no there is no one can get through me to life of eternity because it’s not the way system naturally works, you use me to your advantage but it’s earthly things and for trying to screw me up take my energy lol it’s not my human energy morons because it’s not fed on other humans energy it’s Divine energy within my mortal body to take care of my mortal body not yours that is fed by energy of others. And sun is the source of life that was created by Divine power. I use my human energy to speed the thoughts to process information because a lot of manipulation. 
Sun is my musa and you are my sorrow because I have to use my energy to withstand your manipulation when I want to use to understand my natural senses and I have to figure it out to be less around those lol nice people that have snakes in their hearts it’s monitored by divine system of human life it’s how I know. I know that nothing you can hide from that system and why I am open because I know that system and I am not stupid naive lol because when divine system comes with ideas that ideas can be delivered by the one who receives, it’s based on individual mind capacity to process information.

"This is my last comment regarding this catastrophe.  Californians largely supported VP Harris in her run for POTUS. If these  LA fires help those supporters of VP Harris finally understand how the people victimized by the war in Gaza ( in other places, too where America finances killings) suffer due to the constant bombings and fires that kill loved ones, due to blocked access to clean water, healthy foods, comfort and  medical care, then God will speed up the end to these fires.  

How you people in So. California - in America as a whole -  feel now is how victims of wars feel all of the time. VP Harris’ reluctance to publicly denounce Netanyahu’s murderous ways and demand the COTUS and POTUS Biden stop all financial and armed support to Netanyahu, et al should have impacted Californians to vote differently (or do a no-vote like precious Michiganders did).

"Remember Gaza.🇵🇸🇵🇸
Remember the 55,000 innocent civilians who were killed, most of them women and children.
Remember when President Trump said that if the Israeli captives were not returned, the Middle East would ignite—a message from God to you.
Remember that children in Gaza died from hunger, were burned alive in the intense summer heat, and froze to death in the bitter winter as their blood froze in their veins.
Remember that the Israeli occupation's airstrikes targeted innocent civilians, mosques, and worshippers while they prayed.
Remember that humanitarian organizations, child relief agencies, doctors' groups, and the Red Cross rush to save you, but no one moves to help the innocent children of Gaza.
Remember that Palestine is Arab, and the ""Al-Aqsa Flood"" is the rightful effort of the land's owners to liberate their territories.
Remember that you support a war criminal who is internationally wanted for arrest, and instead of supporting his terrorist government, you should hold him accountable.
Remember that in Gaza, entire families have been wiped off the civil registry due to indiscriminate bombings over the heads of children and civilians.
Remember that Arabs never attacked your countries; it is you who occupy our Arab lands.
Remember that you are waging war against Palestine, Yemen, and Lebanon on behalf of a mercenary Zionist occupation army, one that fights not for honor or heritage but for money.
Remember that the world's people are now strongly criticizing you in every country, and we see all these criticisms broadcast on screens, even from within your ministries, parliaments, and institutions.
Do not make the world hate you more than it already does.
Do not become accomplices to the Zionists. If you truly support them without limits, give them a part of your land in America to live on, instead of allowing them to usurp Middle Eastern lands.
You may not believe in Islam, but whatever your religion, your holy books do not command the killing of innocent people, especially children.
In Gaza, every form of death has occurred, with the highest number of limb amputations in the world performed without anesthesia, without treatment, and without hospitals.
There are no hospitals, no medicine, no clean drinking water, no food, and no safe or warm place. Everything is at risk of being erased with no morning light to follow.
Do not be racist. Gaza's children have fair skin, blonde hair, and beautiful faces—disfigured by the occupation army. They have the right to live just like you.
When Gaza burns every day, we do not see firefighters, doctors, or ambulances rushing to help, because all of them are targeted daily.
Wake up, people of the world! Open your eyes! You are destroying humanity, crushing human emotions, and planting cruelty and hatred in our hearts.
Bring peace to every place, so perhaps God will spare you from His severe wrath.🇵🇸
